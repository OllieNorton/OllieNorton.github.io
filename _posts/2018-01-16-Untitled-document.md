Lesson 4

This week I concentrated on fixing my blog, it was very broken. I had just tried to change one simple line of code then the whole blog crashed. I tried out lots of different things before I realised that it was the difference between the repository name and my website's name that was causing the problem. I had to change the name many times before it finally worked.

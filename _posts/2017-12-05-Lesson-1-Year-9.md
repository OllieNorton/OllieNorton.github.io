Lesson 1 Year 9

This is our first IT lesson of this year and we had it with Mr Tanlsy. This is the first time that I have had him and I found him very good. This term we are going to be looking at Google sheets. In the first lesson we were looking at how to create an online shop. We looked at how to look up items and immediately show their price.

    <td>You might be confused as to why this is lesson one but it is like this because I have started a new topic this term. Now instead of working on a fuse box we are working in the Python section of Code Academy. Today was mostly an introductory lesson to Code Academy. We were seeing how the website worked, so familiarizing us on the layout of Code Academy and how to use the Instructions.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning was limited by this being a completely new website so I was slow picking up the basic tools. I also think that now I am not working with other people I will be slower as I find that it really helps working with others.  </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that next time my learning will be even better as I will be more used to Code Academy and I will know all of the tools and the layout.</td>

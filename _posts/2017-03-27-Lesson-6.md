    <td>We carried on with the same method which is very effective, we have one person reading the script, one person coding and one person checking the code. This works really well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that my learning limitations were not speaking loud/clear enough. This lead to confusion in our group and cost us some time. This can be easily evaded if we take more time and care.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that when I am reading I make it as clear as possible and that I use all of the correct language. I will speak louder.  </td>

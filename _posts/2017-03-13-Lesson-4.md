    <td>During our lesson Tommy, Louis and I were working on a game which asked us first what our name was and then it asked us if we wanted to play a game. Then we had to give what happens if the user either says yes or no. This was learning how to cope with multiple answers to a situation, this skill will come in very useful in the future as we move onto more complicated situations. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my main learning limitation was the fact that I wasn't thinking of how much time we have when I was working. This then led us to not finishing one of the exercises we could have done. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I said before my main limitation was time so in our next lesson I will keep track and work a lot quicker.</td>

Lesson Eight

In this lesson we looked at artificial intelligence. At  the start we looked at two examples, one of which you could have a conversation with and one that you couldn't (because it made no sense). We then looked at how to make some artificial intelligence of our own. We made it ask the user questions like, "what is your name?" and “How are you?”. For our homework we had to make three more questions.

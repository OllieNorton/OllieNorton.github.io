    <td>So I wasn't' there last week because I was ill so my group had to teach me everything, Tommy and Louis were both really good teachers and I learnt the basic controls. First we had to make our monitor say " Hello World" and then waited one second and said it again. After that we made another program which was with boys and girls in the class. Then we saved them both onto all of our memory sticks. After we saved it, we started work on a new program which said that “ we have 6 apples. If we eat one… then we will have five.” I did the programming for that one and Louis read out the code for me.q</td>
